<span class="i0">"Come hither, George," young Edmund cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Come quickly here to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For yonder floats the little boat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the swelling sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i2">We soon could push from shore."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh! go not, Edmund," George replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"The storm is rising fast,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Before the howling blast."<br /></span>

<span class="i2">When pleasure is in view."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In anger Edmund spoke, and turn'd<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In pride and scorn away,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Toss'd in the little bay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He loos'd the rope, he seized the oar,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Flies through the stormy tide.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The wind is loud, the waves are strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And vainly Edmund strives<br /></span>

<h2>ANNY.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O look!" the little Fanny cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As wandering by her mother's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They pass'd a cottage neat tho' poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With woodbines clustering round the door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh look, mamma, what lovely flowers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I here could stand and gaze for hours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beauteous rose, those lilies fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that gay bed of tulips there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! how I wish they all were mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'd make my empty garden shine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Your empty garden, Fanny! pray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have all your flowers been stol'n away?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or do you for your neighbour's sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because your own you leave to die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little girl whose flowers these are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watches and prunes them all with care;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><span class="i0">She rises early, labours hard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And does not toil nor care regard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thinks her trouble well repaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she her parents thus can aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These flowers to market off she takes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many pence by them she makes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You surely, therefore, would not strive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of this advantage to deprive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grateful child, who takes such pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To help her parents' scanty gains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But come, my love, we must not stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That show'r will reach us on our way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, Fanny, come,"&mdash;"Mamma, I will,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Fanny staid and linger'd still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each plant and flower at length being view'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her way she thoughtfully pursu'd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A week had pass'd, when Fanny ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her mamma, and thus began:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mamma, when you have time, I pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you would kindly walk this way,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><span class="i0">And let me show you what, last night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I finish'd ready for your sight."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mamma complies, and Fanny bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delighted, through the verdant grounds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sparkling eye and step elate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Open she throws the garden gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And look!" she cries, in joyful tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What play-hours in one week have done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No weeds do now my garden spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stones I clear'd, and turn'd the soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees I prun'd, I planted flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And water'd them with plenteous showers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, mamma, with time and care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some nosegays I may hence prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that good girl, who takes such pains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To help her parents' scanty gains."<br /></span>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
